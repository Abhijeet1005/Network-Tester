# Network-Tester
A simple tool to test the download speed of a file from across the world.


This project uses three easy to understand python scripts:

1> main.py which holds all the logic and which also stores the testing data in a results.txt file after the program tests all the proxies.
2> proxies.py which stores all the proxies for testing.
3> api.py which will simply present the data in results.txt after the run
